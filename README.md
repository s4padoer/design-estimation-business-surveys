## Computer codes for "Design and Estimation in Business Surveys - Selected Topics" by Patricia Dörr (2020)

This repository contains the computer code for the functions and simulations described in the PhD thesis "Design and Estimation in Business Surveys - Selected Topics" by Patricia Dörr (2020). 

The codes are arranged according to the chapters that the algorithms/ simulations can be found in, which means:

***Multilevel Regression Analysis in Business Surveys (Chapter 2)***

- Monte-Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm for survey weighted (non-)Gaussian regression models (R Package wmm)
- Simulation study for testing the algorithm under (non-)informative survey designs
- Application to business survey data
          
***GVFs in Business Surveys (Chapter 3)*** 

- Simulation study for testing the model-design theory of generalized variance functions (GVFs)

***A Multivariate Probability Density Estimator using SOMs (Chapter 4)***

- Modified and dynamic batch self-organizing map algorithm with adaptive distances
- Density estimator built upon the modified SOM algorithm
- Simulation study to compare the density estimator to Gaussian mixtures and kernel density estimators
- Application to business survey data
